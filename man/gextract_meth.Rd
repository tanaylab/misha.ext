gextract_meth(
  tracks,
  names = NULL,

  iterator = "intervs.global.seq_CG",
  d_expand = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{tracks}{name of methylation track suffix (without ".cov" or ".meth")}

\item{names}{sets the columns names in the returned value.}

\item{intervals}{genomic scope for which the function is applied}

\item{iterator}{track expression iterator. If "NULL" iterator is based on CpGs}

\item{d_expand}{smooth the methylation signal \code{d_expand} bp from each side (optional).}

\item{join_intervals}{add the intervals to the returned data frame (using left_join)}

\item{extract_meth_calls}{extract also methylation calls (".meth" tracks)}

\item{...}{additional arguments to \link[misha]{gextract}}
}
\value{
data frame with a column with average methylation for each track, and another column with ".cov" suffix with every track's coverage. If \code{extract_meth_calls} is TRUE - additional columns with ".meth" suffix with number of methylation calls per track.
